Importance of identifying design properties

The importance of identifying design properties of a mockup lies in ensuring that the final implementation accurately reflects the designerâ€™s vision. It promotes visual consistency, supports reusable components, improves collaboration between design and development teams, and enhances responsiveness and accessibility. By defining elements such as color schemes, typography, spacing, and component behavior early, developers can build user interfaces that are both functional and visually coherent.
